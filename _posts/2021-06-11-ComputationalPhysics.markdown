# Computational Physics Questions Repository
I've created the and uploaded the first two questions to the Computational Physics Questions repository.
This set of questions will grow over time, and will be arranged by course, and then topic within the course, and 
by descriptive subfolders. Each question will reside within its own folder containing python and julia .ipynb files along with
needed image files. 

I will not post questions until I have complete solutions available (but these will only be available to instructors).

The questions I have uploaded are in Electrodynamics (we use Griffiths' text, as do many colleges/universities)

The first is a simple question (designed to be assigned in addition to 1.3 in Griffiths) 
to get students to use the vector capabilities of 

	- numPy in Python
	- built-in capability in Julia
	
The second question is relevant for Ch.5 in Griffiths' --it uses the Biot-Savart Law to 
compute the magnetic field on the axis of a current loop. There will be another Biot-Savart 
question where students will compute the field off-axis, but I haven't written that one yet. 

For some reason I haven't figured out, the notebooks don't render in Github (anyone know a fix?)
but they do in the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/paulnakroshis/ComputationalPhysicsQuestions/tree/main/).
